Below are three great examples of data visualization -- watching them is highly recommended, but not required

[The West Wing: Mercator vs Gall-Peters projection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVX-PrBRtTY) - A great intro to map projections. Last year, [Boston became the first city](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520938221/boston-students-get-a-glimpse-of-a-whole-new-world-with-different-maps) to introduce the Gall-Peters projection in public schools.

[Hans Rosling: The best stats you've ever seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) - Outstanding presentation in every respect. See if you can count how many dimensions are visualized in the graphic.

[The Fallen of WWII](http://www.fallen.io/) - "Cinematic" data visualization by Neil Halloran, a fellow Philadelphian. Created using only Javascript.
